 /* 
In the case of UDP socket programming, the loop described in the 
provided code is used to handle multiple client communications concurrently, 
rather than sequentially accepting connections from multiple clients as you might see in TCP socket programming.
With UDP, each client communicates with the server by sending individual datagrams (packets), 
and the server can handle these datagrams independently. The server does not establish a persistent connection with 
each client as in TCP; instead, it simply listens for incoming datagrams and responds to them.

  /*n the recvfrom() function call, client_addr_len represents the size of the client_addr structure that is passed as an argument.

The recvfrom() function is used to receive messages from a socket. 
When using UDP sockets, it's common to receive messages from different clients. To identify the sender of the received message, 
recvfrom() expects a pointer to a socket address structure (struct sockaddr) where it can store the sender's address.
 Additionally, it also requires the size of this address structure.*/
